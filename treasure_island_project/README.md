# Treasure Island

A small Python text-based adventure game where the player makes choices to find a hidden treasure. This project demonstrates conditional logic, user input handling, and basic ASCII art in Python.

## Key Features / Concepts
- Input handling with `input()`
- Conditional statements (`if/elif/else`)
- String methods (`.lower()`) for consistent input handling
- Basic ASCII art in Python

## Example Usage
```text
Welcome to Treasure Island.
Your mission is to find the treasure.
You're at a cross road. Where do you want to go?
Type 'left' or 'right' 
> left
You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake.
Type 'wait' for a boat or 'swim' to swim across
> wait
You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors: red, yellow, blue.
Which color do you choose?
> yellow
You win!
```
## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone <your-repo-url>`

2. Navigate to the Treasure Island folder.  

3. Run the program in your Python environment:  
   `python treasure_island.py`

4. Follow the prompts to play the game.

## Notes / Learning Points
- Practiced nested conditional logic
- Learned to handle user input and normalize text
- Applied ASCII art to make the game visually interesting
